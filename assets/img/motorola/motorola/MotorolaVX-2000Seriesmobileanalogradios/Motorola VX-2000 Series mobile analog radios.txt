Motorola VX-2000 Series mobile analog radios
For basic mobile communications, look to the VX-2100/2200 Series.

Choose from two mobile analogue radios: the VX-2100 (without display) and VX-2200 (with display). They install easily in small spaces, and their die-cast aluminium construction helps dissipate heat and absorb vibration for added durability.

The channel capacity is 8 channels for easy operation on the VX-2100 or 128 channels for large group communications on the VX-2200. And optimise your operations with multiple scanning options.
