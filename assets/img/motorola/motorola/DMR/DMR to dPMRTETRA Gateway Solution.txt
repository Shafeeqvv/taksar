DMR to dPMR/TETRA Gateway Solution
Simple solutions to bridge between DMR and other radio networks

Our two solutions cover:

- DMR to dPMR
- DMR to TETRA

There are many options for connecting DMR to other radio networks, the vast majority are based around dispatcher solutions.

These solutions by nature allow one side of the connection to be fully managed whereas the ‘other’ radio side is hard-programmed. This as a result can be an expensive solution without the full range of features.

The real requirement/day to day usage between the two networks is a connection between SMT and/or similar groups.

So to address this, Danimex has developed a simple “back 2 back gateway” solution that will allow two groups to be in effect virtually hardwired together, thus enabling a seamless GROUP 2 GROUP call between key users.

If other groups are required more gateways can be added without problems.
