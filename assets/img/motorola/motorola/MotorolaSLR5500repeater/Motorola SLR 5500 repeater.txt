Motorola SLR 5500 repeater
The SLR 5500 represents a huge leap forward in design and technology. Based on a wealth of field experience, customer feedback and technological innovation, the product delivers outstanding performance and efficiency for your business two-way radio system. From rock-solid reliability to clever touches like an integrated battery charger, the SLR 5500 is truly the next generation in repeaters. 

Danimex has developed a unique duplexer dock for the SLR 5500 REPEATER to integrate a duplex filter directly into the same casing as the SLR 5500 REPEATER, making mounting solution easier for wall, desk and rack.
