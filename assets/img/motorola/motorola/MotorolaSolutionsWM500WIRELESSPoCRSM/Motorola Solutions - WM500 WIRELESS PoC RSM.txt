Motorola Solutions - WM500 WIRELESS PoC RSM 
The WM500 is Motorola Solutions' first wireless RSM compatible with PTT-over-cellular applications.

With the WM500, you can leave your phone in your pocket while retaining access to key POC functionality

 

When you need quick access to PTT applications on your two-way radio or smartphone, the WM500 is the solutions for you. The WM500 is uniquely designed to give you the simplicity and security you need to perform your job efficiently and effectively.

The WM500 wireless remote speaker microphone is Motorola's thinnest  RSM yet, and is built with an internal battery that lasts up to 40 hours so you can remain focused on the task at hand.

Windporting technology allows you to communicate clearly in difficult weather by eliminating the whining and howling sounds of wind blowing across your remote speaker microphone. A 3.5mm earpiece jack provides you the flexibility to receive audio communications more effectively.

Designed for durability, this RSM is rated IP67 meaning it can withstand immersion for at least 30 minutes, while preventing water from clogging the microphone and is completely dust-tight.
