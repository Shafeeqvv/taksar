Motorola Accessories - Batteries & Chargers
Different sizes, capacities and types of batteries and chargers are available to meet a wide variety of user requirements.


Choosing the right charger

• Single-unit chargers (SUCs) are ideal for individual users
• Tri-unit chargers allow SL4000 users to charge a radio, spare battery and USB accessory simultaneously
• MULTI-unit chargers (MUCs) for larger fleets charge up to six radios at the same time.
• Fixed or on-the-move. SUCs and MUCs get their power form the mains electricity and are intended for use in static environments. Users who want to recharge their radio whilst on the move in a car or truck should use travel charger that takes its power from the cigarette lighter/ DC power socket.
• IMPRES: Automatic battery charging and conditioning helps prolong lifetime by more than 40% compared to non-IMPRES batteries.
• Information display: IMPRES battery status and charge capacity can be displayed, taking the guess work out of managing battery fleets.


Choosing the right battery
Factors to consider: required run time, operating modes (e.g. GPS updates), chemistry type, operating environment and intrinsic safety regulators.
