Rugged design 
The 9350 Antenna is constructed to withstand harsh field and environmental conditions. It meets or exceeds the shock and vibrations requirement for MIL-STD-810. 
 
Fast, optimum tuning 
Typically, the 9350 takes only a few seconds to tune to any frequency 

High radiation efficiency 
The 9350 antenna has a comparably high rate of radiation efficiency, rated for maximum voice power of 125 watts PEP. 
 
Continuous tuning 
The whip antenna provides continuous tuning to any required frequency over the transmit/receive operating range of 2–30 MHz. 

Two whips supplied 
Two whip top sections are provided with the 9350 antenna – the primary whip encased in polyurethane covered fiberglass, and a shorter backup whip made from stainless steel. 
 
Sensitive to weak signals 
When in Scan or Free Tune Receiver mode, a broadband amplifier is activated. This makes the antenna sensitive to even the weakest signals over the entire frequency range.
