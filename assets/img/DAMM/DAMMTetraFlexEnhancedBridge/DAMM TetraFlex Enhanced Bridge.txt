DAMM TetraFlex Enhanced Bridge
The DAMM TetraFlex Enhanced Bridge is a comprehensive network interconnection tool that can be used as an Inter-System Interface (ISI). It allows interoperation with a foreign system or migration of terminals from a foreign system to a DAMM system and vice versa and enables cross-system group and individual communication. The DAMM IP network works according to the TETRA standard and is thus independent of the feature set and software status of the existing system – this is superior to any standard ISI solution available on the market.
