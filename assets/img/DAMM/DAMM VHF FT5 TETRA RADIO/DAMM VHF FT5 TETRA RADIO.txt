DAMM VHF FT5 TETRA RADIO 
The VHF FT5 TETRA radio provides all the key features you come to expect in TETRA such as high output power, full TETRA feature set and positioning. It is robust and shock resistant and its IP65 protection makes it ideal for outdoor use in wet and dusty environments. The radio combines the strength of TETRA with the wide coverage in open rural areas made possible by VHF frequencies. The VHF FT5 can be operated through DAMMâ€™s MultiTech Outdoor Base Station in a VHF-only network or a network consisting of separate base stations using either VHF or UHF frequencies.
