Avigilon presence detector (APD)
The Avigilon Presence Detector (APD) is a small form-factor impulse radar device, with self-learning radar analytics that scans, learns and continuously adapts to the environment. This enables it to provide extremely high accuracy in detecting the presence of a person at distances up to 9 meters (30 feet) from the sensor, even if the object is hidden or obstructed by objects such as blankets, cardboard, wood and drywall.



Impulse Radar Technology
Effectively detects people even when they are not moving while also being able to detect fine motion, such as breathing, to alert you of the presence of a person.

Complete Privacy
Using radar technology for detection, the APD ensures complete privacy as it does not capture or display items such as ATM keypads or faces.

Easy-to-install
Low profile and discreet design easily blend into its surroundings. Available in surface and wall mount options, the APD uses standard IP security camera infrastructure and cabling for easy installation.

VMS Integration
Integrates with Avigilon Control Centerâ„¢ video management software to provide accurate alarm notifications of important events so that you can take action.
