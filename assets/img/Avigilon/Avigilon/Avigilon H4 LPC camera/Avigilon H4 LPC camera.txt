Avigilon H4 LPC camera
For applications where it is critical to obtain character recognition at typical vehicle speeds, the Avigilon H4 LPC camera is designed to capture vehicle license plates—even in challenging lighting conditions. Using infrared illumination and visible light filtering, H4 LPC cameras enable Avigilon License Plate Recognition (LPR) analytics technology to accurately identify license plate characters from a range of distances.
